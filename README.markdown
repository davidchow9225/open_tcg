# OpenTCG: Trading Card API
## A simple way to simulate new and existing Trading Cards.

### Introduction
**OpenTCG** is a _purely_ `Python 3.10+` implementation of object-oriented programming aimed at being a simple API facilitating the creation and use of trading card objects for use in projects such as games, card creation/deck management apps, and more. \
In addition to the basic `open_tcg.Card()` class, this API comes with an example using the popular **Yu-Gi-Oh** trading card game.

### How To Use
To use OpenTCG, import it into a Python module.
```python
import open_tcg

Alternatively, you can simply import the `Card()` class.
```python
from open_tcg import Card
```
